Sometimes, you no longer need a package, or an older version of a package. `choco delete` makes it easy to remove those unnecessary packages. The extension has this capability built in

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to bring up the Command Pallete and type `Chocolatey: Delete Package`. Select the Chocolatey package nupkg to remove and it will be deleted from disk.
